Requirements
============

- JDK 7+
- Java application server supporting Java servlet technology (tomcat, wildfly, ...)
- Maven tool (if building is necessary)
- Executable computational application for each desired computational type

Install guide
=============
For instance I will use Debian amd64 with Wildfly 8.2 application server, JDK 8 and Maven 3.1


1. Install JDK 8

   Download JDK from
        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
        in zip file form, for example jdk-8u45-linux-x64.tar.gz
   Extract archive to /usr/lib/jvm
   Setup enviroment variables for java 
   add these lines to the end of /etc/profile
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.45  
        export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin

2. Install Wildfly 8.2.0

    Download zip from http://wildfly.org/downloads/
    Extract archive to the /usr/local
    In the newly extracted wildfly directory execute bin/add-user.sh and setup new wildfly administering user.
   
3. Start Wildfly by executing bin/standalone.sh

    Server should successfully start.
    If everything went OK:
    Server is running on http://localhost:8080/
    Admin console on http://localhost:9990/

4. Configure universal-worker configuration file (optional step if you want another configuration that it is in prebuilt archive) 

    Download sources of universal-worker
    Go to src/main/resources/
    Adjust uws-config.xml file
    Go back to sources root
    Execute command "mvn package"
    Worker is compiled and the deployable archive is created in target/universal-worker.war
    
5. Deploy universal worker to Wildfly

    Open Wildfly admin console on http://localhost:9990/
    Login with the credentials of administrating user
    Navigate to Deployments section
    Click Add
    Select deployable universal-worker.war archive
    Click OK
    Enable the newly deployed application

    UWS service should now run on
    http://localhost:8080/universal-worker/uws
    

Note: This is only description of universal-worker application which serves as the mediator between the master server and executable computational application. In order to make a worker fully functional you have to set the configuration file of the universal-worker to point to the valid locations of the executable computational applications. For more information see the documentation of the specific executable computational application.
